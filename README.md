# springboot-graphql-sample
Sample springboot API for showcasing building and testing GraphQL API

In this project we have created two GraphQL API's -->
1) Create Student Record
2) Fetch the record by Student's name

To keep the application simple and to the scope we are using map for student record's persistence.

Running the app:
1) Checkout the code
2) It is a SpringBoot app. If you are using IDE or STS you get the run option in the tool itself

OR from the command prompt run below command -->
   `mvn clean spring-boot:run`

Go to http://localhost:8080/graphiql
